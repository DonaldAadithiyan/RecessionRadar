ENHANCED RECESSION PREDICTION ENSEMBLE - DYNAMIC WEIGHTS
============================================================

Generated: 2025-10-17 09:38:37.868961
Models saved: 1
Targets: recession_probability, 1_month_recession_probability, 3_month_recession_probability, 6_month_recession_probability

MODEL DETAILS:
--------------------
Enhanced Stacking (Learned Weights):
  Type: ImprovedStackingEnsemble
  Size: 17.59 MB

WEIGHT STRATEGY:
------------------------------
• NO fixed weights used
• Weights are learned per target via ElasticNet meta-model
• Each target has its own optimal weight combination
• Meta-model coefficients determine final ensemble predictions
• Weights optimized through nested cross-validation

ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
------------------------------
• Improved feature scaling (RobustScaler/StandardScaler)
• Enhanced hyperparameter tuning with early stopping
• Stratified cross-validation based on target quantiles
• Feature engineering for meta-learning
• ElasticNet meta-models with nested cross-validation
• Better data cleaning and transformation
• Early stopping and validation sets
