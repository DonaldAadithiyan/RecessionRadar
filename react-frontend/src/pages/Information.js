            RecessionRadar is a dashboard for visualizing and forecasting the probability of a recession occurring within different time horizons based on economic indicators.

            How It Works
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            RecessionRadar uses machine learning models trained on historical economic data to predict the probability of a recession occurring within 1, 3, and 6 months.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            The models take into account various economic indicators, including:

            <Typography paragraph>
              The model uses several key economic indicators that help predict recessions:
            </Typography>
            
            <ul>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>Yield Curve Inversion</strong> - When short-term interest rates (such as the 3-Month Treasury rate) exceed long-term rates (such as the 10-Year rate), it indicates an inverted yield curve. Historically, this has been one of the most reliable predictors of U.S. recessions, often signaling a downturn 6â€“18 months in advance.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>OECD Composite Leading Indicator (CLI)</strong> - Designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles, the CLI combines multiple economic variables to detect slowdowns or recoveries before they appear in traditional GDP data.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI)</strong> - Measures consumer confidence in the economy, reflecting household expectations about income, employment, and overall financial conditions. Declining sentiment often precedes reductions in consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI)</strong> - These indicators measure inflation from different perspectives. CPI tracks changes in prices paid by consumers, while PPI tracks prices received by domestic producers. High or volatile inflation can signal economic imbalances and policy tightening risks.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>Industrial Production</strong> - Represents the total output of factories, mines, and utilities. Sustained declines in industrial production are frequently associated with economic contractions and reduced business activity.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>Share Prices</strong> - Stock market performance reflects investor expectations about future economic growth and corporate earnings. Falling share prices often coincide with declining confidence and heightened recession risks.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>Unemployment Rate</strong> - Tracks the proportion of the labor force that is jobless and seeking employment. A rising unemployment rate indicates weakening labor markets and is a classic signal of recessionary pressure.
              </Typography>
              <Typography component="li" paragraph>
                <strong>GDP per Capita</strong> - Measures total economic output per person, providing a broad indicator of living standards and overall economic health. Declining GDP per capita can suggest reduced productivity and economic stagnation.

              The Treasury yield curve is a key economic indicator that plots interest rates of U.S. Treasury bonds at different maturities. 
              In a normal economic environment, longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds, creating an upward-sloping curve.

              Why the yield curve matters:
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              An inverted yield curve (particularly when the 3-Month rate exceeds the 10-Year rate) has preceded every U.S. recession 
              since 1955, with a typical lead time of 6-18 months. This happens because investors expect economic weakness and 
              lower inflation in the future, driving demand for longer-term bonds and pushing their yields down.
