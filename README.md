# ðŸ§  US Recession Forecasting

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Forecasting future recessions can help policy makers and businesses take preventive actions or prepare for economic downturns. In this project, we aim to use historical economic indicators to predict the probability of a recession in the United States occurring **1, 3, or 6 months ahead**.

Understanding economic downturns and their leading indicators can help:
- **Government** agencies design better policies,
- **Investors** manage risks more effectively,
- **Businesses** plan for supply, demand, and workforce accordingly.
